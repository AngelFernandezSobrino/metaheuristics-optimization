    """A class that can be used to store a bunch of data dynamically.

    This class allows for unspecified attributes to have a default value
    of None.  This borrows the output formatting ideas from the
    ActiveState Code Container (recipe 496697).

    For historical reasons, attributes / keys are stored in the
    underlying dict unless they begin with an underscore, in which case
    they are stored as object attributes.
